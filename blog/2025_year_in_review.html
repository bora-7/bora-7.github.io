    <h3 id="2025-year-in-review">2025 year-in-review</h3>
    <p>I was inspired to write this after reading Riley Walz&#39;s Year in Review posts. This year was pretty eventful,
        in no particular order:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Visited 7 different countries, which is more in one year than I&#39;ve visited ever before. 6 of those
            I&#39;ve visited for the first time. I will write in brackets what I remember the most about each of them:
            Ireland (Guinness), Italy (architecture), Norway (best coffee), Spain (art - Reina Sofia), Finland
            (hackathon) and China (too much to mention... parks in Dongguan?)</li>
        <li>Saw 2 of my favourite London bands break up: Tapir! and Famous. I got to see Famous&#39; last gig at the
            Institute of Contemporary Arts, it was such a bittersweet ending (<a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pHucph0Klc">love will find a way...</a>) I never got to see
            Tapir! live which will remain as a big regret, but I got to see their lead singer Evelyn perform at the
            Windmill and she played my favourite Tapir! song, <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj1sh-_sRpA&amp;list=PLBCYJDQ1g88CUGQ5XKSJEprcc95jvbTNU&amp;index=7">Gymnopédie</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Started Bootleg.fm in March because I wanted a place where I can browse live bootlegs of a few
            Windmill-scene bands that I like (Black Midi, Black Country, New Road and Squid). Many fans of different
            bands joined since then, and the archive went from 30 bootlegs (all added by me) to 2000+ bootlegs added by
            100+ people. From 3 pages for bands mentioned above to 30+ pages, as requested by fans, which introduced me
            to many new bands.</li>
        <li>Through Bootleg.fm I learned of Godspeed You!, Black Emperor (often abbreviated as GYBE), and after
            interacting with their fans for most of the year while making their <a
                href="https://gybe.bootleg.fm/">bootleg catalogue</a>, I got to see them live in Hong Kong at the end of
            the year (and on my birthday). Obviously, I had to tape the show. It was my first time taping a gig, and it
            turned out pretty good.
        </li>
        <img src="/images/gybemic.jpg" class="blog-image" alt="recording gybe in HK with zoom h4e">
        <li>Ran the Windsor Half Marathon, which marked the second time I ran one. My time was around 2 hours 4 minutes,
            which was around 5 minutes faster than my first one. I was aiming for sub-2 hours this time, but the route
            was pretty hilly and I didn&#39;t prepare that much, so I&#39;m happy with my time.
        </li>
        <img src="/images/whm.png" class="blog-image" alt="half marathon time according to strava">
        <li>Worked full-time for the entire year for the first time. Previously I&#39;ve worked full-time in 3-month
            chunks, since they were internships.</li>
        <li>Connected with a few paintings. Went to Madrid with two artist friends, and visited two galleries: Reina
            Sofia and Museo del Prado. Last time I&#39;ve been to a gallery was ages ago on trips with family, and I never
            actually appreciated any painting like I did with music or film. <a href="https://ofcanaan.com/">David</a>
            helped me analyse and &#39;digest&#39; paintings better when in Madrid, and I made a list of paintings that
            spoke to me. El Descanso by Ponce de Leòn was my favourite.</li>
        <img src="/images/eldescanso.jpg" class="blog-image" alt="El Descanso">
        <li>Read 4 more books by Kurt Vonnegut, who remains as my favourite author. I first read Slaughterhouse-Five a
            few years ago, then Cat&#39;s Cradle, and have been going through his bibliography since. I&#39;ve been
            taking my time reading them since each one is so enjoyable, and I don&#39;t want to finish all of his books
            so quickly. This year I read God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater for the second time (and it became my favourite).
            I read Jailbird, Galapagos, Bluebeard and Hocus Pocus for the first time. Only Timequake left now...</li>
        <li>Got into David Lynch&#39;s work, after reading online about him after he passed away earlier this year. I
            watched Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet, The Lost Highway, Eraserhead and Twin Peaks Season One. I&#39;m
            watching Twin Peaks Season Two now. I&#39;ve enjoyed everything I&#39;ve seen by him so far, but Mulholland
            Drive has been my favourite. So many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UozhOo0Dt4o">iconic</a> <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVI-Jew-iHo">scenes</a> in that one.</li>
        <li>I (along with Divy, Noah and Na) won first place for the Snap Inc challenge, in HackJunction in Finland. It
            was a 48-hour hackathon, and it took us a while to get used to the Snap AR glasses (named Spectacles) and
            decide what we wanted to build. Around 12-14 hours before submission deadline, we locked in and built a demo
            application, which we then used to record a presentation video at 4am in the freezing Finland weather.
        </li>
        <img src="/images/finlandhackathon.jpg" class="blog-image" alt="after winning hack junction">
        <li>Went to China for the first time, visiting Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Dongguan. I got a cold in
            Beijing (should have worn thicker) and while I was resting for a few days, I started reading Journey to the
            West. It was a very entertaining read and reignited my interest in Eastern religions and meditation.</li>
        <img src="/images/forbiddencity.jpg" class="blog-image" alt="after winning hack junction">
        <li>Started interviewing people for the Bootleg.fm blog, and enjoyed the interviewing process a lot. Got to know
            many people from the London scene better (like <a
                href="https://bootleg.fm/blog/post/roustghoti-interview">roustghoti</a> and <a
                href="https://bootleg.fm/blog/post/lou-smith-interview">Lou Smith</a>, who are legends in the scene),
            also got to interview <a href="https://bootleg.fm/blog/post/gordon-raphael-interview">Gordon Raphael</a>,
            who produced my favourite album of all time. Despite producing some of the best albums of all time, Gordon
            is incredibly humble and it was a great pleasure chatting with him about music and The Strokes.</li>
