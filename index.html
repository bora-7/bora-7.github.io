    <h1>Bora Akyuz</h1>
    <p>Hi I'm Bora. This is the website where I'll store my personal projects and non-regular blog entries.
        When I'm not building software, I like spending time reading fiction (Kurt Vonnegut is my favourite),
        going to local gigs (usually post-punk) and traveling around the world.</p>

    <p>
        I've previously done software engineering internships at American Express, MLH Fellowship (with AWS) and
        Bloomberg LP.
        If you have a software idea that I could be interested in, you can email me at: "tboraakyuz (at) gmail (dot)
        com".
    </p>
