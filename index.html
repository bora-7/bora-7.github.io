    <h1>Bora Akyuz</h1>
    <p>Hi I'm Bora. This is the website where I'll store my personal projects and non-regular blog entries.
        When I'm not building software, I like spending time reading fiction (Kurt Vonnegut is my favourite),
        going to local gigs (usually post-punk) and traveling around the world.</p>

    <p>
        I've previously done software engineering internships at American Express, MLH Fellowship (with AWS) and
        Bloomberg LP.
        If you have a software idea that I could be interested in, you can email me at: "tboraakyuz (at) gmail (dot)
        com".
    </p>

    <p><b>Personal projects</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/bora-7/tdk-12-kindle" target="_blank"> TDK-12 JSON/Kindle </a> - 2024</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Scraped the latest edition (12th) of the official Turkish dictionary using a concurrency-based approach,
                and aggregated all 99,182 definitions
                into a JSON file. </li>
            <li>Used the JSON file to make a Kindle port of the dictionary, released it to the public with instructions
                and
                images <a href="https://tdk.boraakyuz.me/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><a href="https://leettab.boraakyuz.me/" target="_blank"> LeetTab (Leetcode Dashboard) </a> - 2023</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A start-page extension that shows your upcoming interviews and Leetcode stats, for Chrome and Firefox
            </li>
            <li>Over 100 users and an average of 5.0/5.0 in reviews at the time of writing. It (somehow) ended up on
                Chinese pirate websites
                which is a testament to its usefulness.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><a href="https://thescene.io/" target="_blank"> Seeker (Artist Scraping) </a> - 2023</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Scraping over 10k artist data from Spotify daily, storing and charting this data in a desktop app
                available in MacOS, Windows, Linux (Ubuntu).</li>
            <li>Early access version used by artist managers in London. You need to be given an account to use it.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><a href="https://booking.warwickbandsoc.co.uk/" target="_blank"> Bandsoc Booking Page </a> - 2023</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Heavily used during term time.</li>
            <li>Replaced the spreadsheet that the soc was using with this page, where members make accounts and buy
                credits to book practice room slots.</li>
            <li>Led to an increase in profit of more than 60%, and eased the role of the treasurer since they don't have
                to check if the money is sent for each person anymore.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><a href="https://www.warwickbandsoc.co.uk/" target="_blank">Warwick Band Society Website</a> - 2022</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The homepage was done using NextJS with typescript.</li>
            <li>This set the foundation to build the booking page, which was a project bigger in scale.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><a href="https://accomsuggester.boraakyuz.me/" target="_blank">Warwick Accommodation Suggester</a> -
            2021</li>
        <ul>
            <li>My first solo project, built during the summer of 2021, after my first year at the university
                of warwick.</li>
            <li>I used vanilla JS and no CSS frameworks so I could learn those better before diving into frameworks.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
